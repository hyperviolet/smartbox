SmartBox Ecig
//This is a project I am working on to write software for an ecig box mod. 
I am a novice programmer, but I feel like i have a great idea nad I don't want to pay someone else to create it for me. 
I want to be able to take a small chip and write a basic program to it with some extra feature as well.
So the basics are; watts/volts increase & decrease buttons, fire button, miniusb charger, bluetooth connectivity, 
and temperature monitor.
In addition to this I also want to write a simple program for android/ios that will communicate with the mod via bluetooth
in the program it will show usage history/statistics
energy saver settings temperature settings and a control to change the color of the LED's on the mod.

This is the basic plan for the project. I have many obstacles that I need to overcome.

First, I can write simple programs on visual studio, but I don't know how I would write one to a phone or to a chip.
Second, I don't know how I will setup the bluetooth or the temperature monitor. 

Please, if you have ideas or samples for code for any of the above please please feel free to share it 
or to walk me through a few steps to get started. Thank you so much for helping me start building my dream
